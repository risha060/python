Write a Python program to do arithmetical operations
# Store input numbers: 
num1 = input('Enter first number: ') 
num2 = input('Enter second number: ') 
 
# Add two numbers 
sum = float(num1) + float(num2) 
# Subtract two numbers 
min = float(num1) - float(num2) 
# Multiply two numbers 
mul = float(num1) * float(num2) 
#Divide two numbers 
div = float(num1) / float(num2) 
#Divide floor two numbers 
divf = float(num1) // float(num2)
#Modulus two numbers 
Modul = int(num1) % int(num2)
#Power or Exponent two numbers
expo = int(num1) ** int(num2) 
# Display the sum 
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum)) 
 # Display the subtraction 
print('The subtraction of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, min)) 
# Display the multiplication 
print('The multiplication of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, mul)) 
# Display the division 
print('The division of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, div))
# Display the division floor
print('The division floor of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, divf))
# Display the Modulus 
print('The Modulus of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, Modul))
# Display the Power or Exponent 
print('The exponent or power of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, expo))
Output:
Enter first number: 3
Enter second number: 2
The sum of 3 and 2 is 5.0
The subtraction of 3 and 2 is 1.0 
The multiplication of 3 and 2 is 6.0
The division of 3 and 2 is 1.0
The division floor of 3 and 2 is 1
The Modulus of 3 and 2 is 1
The power of 3 and 2 is 6
