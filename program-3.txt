Write a Python program to find area of triangle
# Three sides of the triangle is a, b and c: 
a = float(input('Enter first side: ')) 
b = float(input('Enter second side: ')) 
c = float(input('Enter third side: ')) 
 # calculate the semi-perimeter 
s = (a + b + c) / 2 
 # calculate the area 
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5 
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area) 
Output:
Enter first side: 5.0
Enter second side: 6.0
Enter third side: 7.0
The area of the triangle is 14.70
