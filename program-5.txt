Write a Python program to swap two variables
P = int( input("Enter value for P: ")) 
Q = int( input("Enter value for Q: ")) 
# To swap the value of two variables 
# we will user third variable which is a temporary variable 
temp_1 = P 
P = Q 
Q = temp_1 
 
print ("The Value of P after swapping: ", P) 
print ("The Value of Q after swapping: ", Q) 
Output:
Please enter value for P: 25
Please enter value for Q: 03
The Value of P after swapping: 03
The Value of Q after swapping: 25
